\section{Introduction: Motivation for Text Processing} \label{sec:Introduction} 

Vast amounts of knowledge are trapped in presentation media such as videos, html, pdfs, and paper as opposed to being concept-mapped, interlinked, addressable and reusable at fine grained levels. This defeats knowledge exchanges between humans and between human cognition and AI-based systems.

It is known that concept mapping enhances human cognition. Especially in domain-specific areas of knowledge, better interlinking would be achieved if concepts would be extracted using surrounding context. ``You shall know a word by the company it keeps" (Firth, 1957). However, in order to scale the benefits, we need to extend this activity to a large base of knowledge. To do that effectively, we can use  machine learning and natural language processing to ensure that the meaning of the concepts are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item statistically relevant in the body of knowledge
    
    \item provably grounded in the resources and the knowledge of the participants (authors, users)
    
    \item evolving with time, a feature of dynamic word embeddings
    
\end{enumerate}

Without these features, we cannot expect participants to adopt the terms and concepts.
